# Search Between plugin for Omeka

This plugin extends the Omeka advanced search form with a way to search between
a range of values.

## Requirements

* Omeka 2.0+

## Installation

1. Download the plugin
2. Extract to the plugins directory of your Omeka installation
3. Install the plugin at `/admin/plugins`

## Configuration

Configure the plugin at `/admin/plugins/config/name/SearchBetween`

## Usage

With the plugin installed, the advanced search form at `/items/search` will

search form field inputs...
